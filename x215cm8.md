Embrace an adaptable, future -ready, and cloud -operated system to simplify IT and 
innovate at the speed of s oftware.  
Product overview  
The Cisco UCS X -Series Modular System simplifies your data center, adapting to the unpredictable needs of 
modern applications while also providing for traditional scale -out and enterprise workloads. It reduces the 
number of server  types to maintain, helping to improve operational efficiency and agility as it helps reduce 
complexity. Powered by the Cisco Intersight cloud -operations platform, it shifts your thinking from 
administrative details to business outcomes —with hybrid -cloud i nfrastructure that is assembled from the cloud, 
shaped to your workloads, and continuously optimized.  
Features and benefits  
Main features  
The Cisco UCS X215c M8 Compute Node is the first generation of AMD compute node to integrate into the 
Cisco UCS X-Series Modular System. It delivers performance, flexibility, and optimization for deployments in 
data centers, in the cloud, and at remote sites. This enterprise -class server offers market -leading performance, 
versatility, and density without compromise for workloads. Up to eight compute nodes can reside in the 7 -
Rack -Unit (7RU) Cisco UCS X9508 Server Chassis, offering one of the highest densities of compute, I/O, and 
storage per rack unit in the industry.  
The Cisco UCS X215c M8 provides these main featur es: 
● CPU:  Up to 2x 4th Gen AMD EPYC™ Processors with up to 96 cores per processor and up to 384 MB of 
Level 3 cache per CPU.  
● Memory: Up to 6TB of main memory with 24x 256 GB DDR5 5600 MT/s or DDR5 4800 MT/s DIMMs 
depending on the CPU installed.  
● Storage:  Up to six hot -pluggable, Solid -State Drives (SSDs), or Non -volatile Memory Express (NVMe) 
2.5-inch drives with a choice of enterprise -class Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAIDs) or 
passthrough controllers, up to two M.2 SATA drives with optional hardwa re RAID or up to two M.2 NVMe 
drives in pass -through mode.  
● Optional front mezzanine GPU module:  The Cisco UCS front mezzanine GPU module is a passive PCIe 
Gen 4.0 front mezzanine option with support for up to two NVMe drives and two HHHL GPUs.  
● mLOM Virtual  Interface Cards (VICs):  
◦ Cisco UCS VIC 15420 occupies the server's modular LAN on motherboard (mLOM) slot, enabling up 
to 50 Gbps of unified fabric connectivity to each of the chassis Intelligent Fabric Modules (IFMs) for 
100 Gbps connectivity per server.  
◦ Cisco UCS VIC 15230 occupies the server's modular LAN on motherboard (mLOM) slot, enabling up 
to 100 Gbps of unified fabric connectivity to each of the chassis Intelligent Fabric Modules (IFMs) for 
100 Gbps connectivity per server with secure boot technolo gy.

◦ Cisco UCS 5th Gen Virtual Interface Card (VIC) 15422 can occupy the server's mezzanine slot at the 
bottom rear of the chassis. This card's I/O connectors link to Cisco UCS X -Fabric technology. An 
included bridge card extends th is VIC's 2x 50 Gbps of network connections through IFM connectors, 
bringing the total bandwidth to 100 Gbps per fabric (for a total of 200 Gbps per server) with secure 
boot technology.  
◦ Cisco UCS PCI Mezz card for X -Fabric can occupy the server's mezzanine slot at the bottom rear of 
the chassis. This card's I/O connectors link to Cisco UCS X -Fabric modules and enable connectivity 
to the Cisco UCS X440p PCIe Node.  
◦ All VIC mezzanine cards also provide I/O connections from the X210c M7 compute node to the X440p  
PCIe Node.  
● Security:  The server supports an optional Trusted Platform Module (TPM). Additional features include a 
secure boot FPGA and ACT2 anti -counterfeit provisions.
