## Overall Description

Accelerate mission-critical applications with power and efficiency

Designed to be as easy to use as it is powerful, Pure Storage 
FlashArray provides unified block and file storage with 
enterprise performance, reliability, and availability to power your 
critical business services. FlashArray//X arrays runs everything 
from massive databases to modern cloud-native apps, with 
purpose-built solutions that scale from large-scale enterprise 
deployments to satellite offices.

## Consolidate More Workloads on Fewer Arrays

The all-NVMe architecture used in FlashArray storage provides the 
performance density that allows you to consolidate more business services—
bigger databases, more applications, more users—on fewer arrays. The always-
on quality of service (QoS) in Purity prevents workloads from hogging resources 
without setting artificial limits, so you’re assured full performance of all your 
workloads. Consolidating workloads not only simplifies operations and 
decreases rack space requirements, but it also reduces power consumption 
and cooling costs to help you meet corporate green data center standards. 

## Next-generation Performance at Cloud-scale

With Pure Fusion and FlashArray, Pure Storage delivers a new infinite scale-
out storage model that unifies arrays and optimizes storage pools on the fly, 
bringing the simplicity of the cloud operating model anywhere, with on-demand 
consumption and back-end provisioning. End users can rapidly consume 
volumes, file systems, and advanced data services like replication without
waiting for back-end manual work, making hardware truly invisible. 

## Innovation without Delay

The pace of innovation is faster than ever, measured in weeks instead of years. 
The unique Evergreen® storage plans from Pure Storage can keep the 
decisions you make today from boxing you in as your data grows, as you roll 
out new services, and as you support more users. With Evergreen, you get immediate 
access to ever-improving capabilities with a right-size guarantee when you purchase, 
and you can look forward to non-disruptive upgrades and capacity expansions 
as your storage needs evolve.

## DirectFlash: Move Beyond SSD

FlashArray//X moves beyond legacy SSD architectures that are architected to make flash pretend to be a hard disk. 
DirectFlash® within Purity speaks directly to raw NAND with a super-efficient NVMe protocol and leverages NVMe-oF over 
DirectFlash Module: A Pure-designed flash module that connects raw flash directly to the FlashArray storage via NVMe. Unlike 
traditional SSDs that use a flash controller or flash translation layer, DirectFlash Module is primarily raw flash. This design 
removes the performance roadblocks of SSDs used by many legacy storage architectures.

DirectFlash software: Manages array I/O globally for a faster, more efficient architecture. DirectFlash software provides 
detailed I/O scheduling and performance management, making I/O performance deterministic and reducing average latency by 
decreasing the number of slow I/O operations that often occur in SSD architectures.

DirectFlash Shelf: Lets you add additional NVMe capacity beyond the FlashArray chassis. DirectFlash Shelf connects to the 
FlashArray storage via NVMe-oF protocol with RDMA over converged (RoCE), leveraging 100GB/sec Ethernet. The shelf 
maintains the ability to support different sizes of DirectFlash Modules as flash density improves.

DirectFlash Fabric: DirectFlash Fabric lowers network latency dramatically and enables enterprise-class reliability and data 
services via shared storage versus DAS. NVMe-oF enables massive optimization between the storage controllers and host 
over fast networking: Fibre Channel, RoCE, and TCP. DirectFlash Fabric delivers greater performance and efficiency gains, 
including offloading the host CPU.

## Purity: The Software-defined Heart of FlashArray 

Purity for FlashArray delivers rich, enterprise-level data services; DirectFlash global flash management; and Evergreen 
improvements with every release. Features such as ActiveCluster for business continuity, ActiveDR for disaster recovery, 
ActiveWorkload for workload migration, VMware Virtual Volumes (vVols), NVMe-oF, Snap to NFS, Purity CloudSnap, and 
SafeMode™ are all examples of new features provided over time with non-disruptive, no-additional-cost Purity upgrades. All 
Purity storage services, APIs, and advanced data services are built-in and included with every array.

• Data reduction: Purity averages an industry-leading 5:1 data reduction with a total efficiency of 10:1 (including thin provisioning). 

• Always-on encryption: Purity’s “encrypt everything” approach provides built-in enterprise-grade data security without user intervention or key management.

• High availability: Purity protects against concurrent dual-drive failures and initiates re-builds automatically within minutes. Purity also treats performance variability as a failure and uses parity to work around bottlenecks to deliver consistent latency.

• Always-on ransomware remediation: Cost-efficient, portable, SafeMode snapshots prevent cyber attackers from tampering with or maliciously destroying critical recovery data.

• Intelligent quality of service (QoS): Purity continuously tunes infrastructure using always-on QoS to prevent workloads from hogging resources and to ensure maximum utilization of the array.

• Faster, more consistent performance: Pure DirectFlash Fabric with support for FibreChannel, RoCE, and TCP gives you maximum throughput with microsecond latency that’s far more predictable than with conventional SSDs.

• Unified storage with file services: If you run NAS-based apps in addition to SAN-based enterprise databases, Purity’s consolidated SAN and NAS capabilities let you avoid the trouble and expense of running two incompatible environments.

• On-demand data portability: Quickly and easily move data where they most cost-effectively meet service level agreements to satisfy your customers: between both physical and virtual machines, between on-premises and the cloud.

## Speed Recovery Effortlessly with ActiveCluster and ActiveDR 

Make slow recovery a thing of the past with Purity, ActiveCluster, and ActiveDR. ActiveCluster uses synchronous replication 
and a symmetric active-active design to deliver zero RPO and zero RTO automatic failovers without user intervention. Unlike 
active-passive implementations, Purity ActiveCluster simultaneously serves I/O on the same volume from both sites. 

ActiveDR offers continuous data protection that seamlessly replicates application data across almost any distance, with the 
lowest possible RPO. ActiveDR radically simplifies remote site recovery with a single failover command, straightforward 
failback (re-protect), and non-disruptive disaster recovery testing. With ActiveDR, you can respond quickly to real-world 
outages and compliance testing requests with a single click or with a single API/CLI command.

## Secure Data Protection with SafeMode Snapshots

Get flexible backup and recovery built for today’s ever-increasing ransomware threats. Immutable snapshots from Pure 
provide simple, built-in, local, and cloud-native protection for FlashArray. FlashArray SafeMode ensures your snapshots will be 
available to help you recover from a cyberattack. With SafeMode enabled, your snapshots cannot be eradicated for a fixed,
configurable period, even by someone with admin privileges. Together, Purity Snapshots, Snap-to-FlashBlade, Snap-to-NFS, and CloudSnap enable free movement of space-efficient copies between FlashArray and FlashBlade® systems, to third-party 
NFS storage, or to the cloud, respectively.

## Simplicity By Design, from Day One
